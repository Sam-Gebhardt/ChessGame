Evaluates the board to find a numerical representation for the strenght of a 
postion. In order to find this number each piece has a base strength along with a positive
or negative modifier based on their current place on the board.

Score = Material_value(White) â€“ Material_value(Black) + Table_value(All the pieces on board).
